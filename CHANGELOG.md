## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

### Added
- Claude Code and Codex adapters with resumable parsers, unknown-event counting and fork/inherited-prefix handling.
- Incremental on-disk scan cache keyed by size, mtime, head hash and byte offset.
- Replay simulator: cache read/write/output costs, long-context tiers, cache TTL/idle effects, summary size,
  post-compaction base context, re-discovery penalty calibrated from observed compactions.
- Two result tiers per model and role: `standard` (optimum) and `headroom` (default).
- Two modes: `lite` (offline, default) and opt-in `deep` (re-summarize at candidate thresholds, probes, LLM judge,
  estimate + `--yes` + hard `--budget`; Claude Code / Codex executors).
- Self-contained HTML report: gears, Pareto frontier, cost curves, token distribution, history-vs-replay overlay,
  lite-vs-deep comparison, sessions table.
- `apply` / `retune` / `revert` with pre-authorization files, backups, manifests and key-level revert for
  Claude Code `modelSettings.<model>.autoCompactWindow` and Codex `model_auto_compact_token_limit`.
- `doctor`, `pricing show|refresh` (models.dev / LiteLLM), `cache info|clear`, `demo`, `--json` output.
- Bundled pricing snapshot with source and date; harness format facts with verification status.
